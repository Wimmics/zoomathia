                    <l n="tr">But ere it long had lain to cool,</l>
                    <l n="tr">One slily peep'd out of the pool,</l>
                    <l n="tr">And finding it a king in jest,</l>
                    <l n="tr">He boldly summoned all the rest.</l>

                    <l n="tr">Of Jove they sought another king,</l>

                    <l n="tr">But he in wrath this answer gave:</l>
                    <l n="tr">"You scorn'd the good king that you had,</l>
                    <l n="tr">And therefore you shall bear the bad."</l>
