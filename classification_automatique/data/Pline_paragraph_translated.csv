They are equal to these, and likewise in Egypt, who sit on their backs, and walk with two feet before the former, who use them as hands.

For this reason only in the last hope is he imbued with evil, seeing that even they themselves hate their own witchcraft, thus sparing themselves the limit which is the last, that it may take hold before captivity. The ball is then dissolved by the sprinkling of warm water. It is not otherwise to kill and spare the rear.
